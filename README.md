## Instructions to use the package

After unzipping the folder containing the project you need to perform some steps before being able to run the notebooks.
1. Install all the required modules (we recommend you create a virtual environment) running the command <br><br>
`pip install -r requirements.txt` <br><br>
inside the project folder.<br><br>
2. Install the bootcamp project module running the command <br><br>
`pip install -e .` <br><br>
3. Copy the raw data files to the folder *data/raw_dataset*. Since the files were extremely large we opted to not
include them in the delivered project folder. <br>Also the files should be named:
   1. product_master.csv
   2. stock.csv<br><br>
4. You can now run the different notebooks in teh exploration/final folder in order to get all the results.
